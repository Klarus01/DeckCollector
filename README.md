# DeckCollector

The game focuses on expanding the card deck, upgrading units and buying new ones. After each wave with a boss, the board expands by adding new buildings and moving them around.

This is what the beginning of the game looks like. From the cards at our disposal, we have a knight(a basic unit that deals damage) and a farmer(a unit that works on farms where it gains gold).

When placing a card, you can also drag a card / unit into your hand. This will cause if the unit has already received some damage to start healing at the same time entering the cooldown - its length depends on how much life the unit has lost. Defeated units go into the hand with double cooldown.

The appearance of the upgrade panel and the store. When you hover over a unit, its current stats and those after an upgrade are shown.

We see that the player has purchased a new unit with axes and that his knight is regenerating health.

All the player's units are highlighted in red. We can also see the upgrade panel later in the game.
